## Introduction

At the beginning, I migrate all my workflow to MacBook pro this year. For I am a medical student, I need a convenient tool to help to copy and paste a lot of things to my study notes. I used[ quicker](https://getquicker.net) before when I was on Windows. But after moving to macOS, I find that there is no tools like that in Windows (may be just because I didn't find). Though there are excellent apps like [Paste](https://pasteapp.io) (AWESOME APP <3) which can copy different types of contents into temp clipboard and also support stack-paste mode, multi-paste modes matter. So I want to write one myself. So comes the PasTk.

## Install

(The project has not release the first beta version up to now)

### Windows User

 [![Windows](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/LambolAlee/PasTk/Python%20application%20on%20Windows?logo=Windows)](https://github.com/LambolAlee/PasTk/actions/workflows/python-app-Windows.yml)

This project has deployed [Github Action](https://github.com/LambolAlee/PasTk/actions/workflows/python-app-Windows.yml), you can download the new generated file there in artifact.

(*There is a puzzling problem I met when packaging the program, for detail you can see this [issue]()*)

**For now**, there is another method which is even more convenient comparing to double clickcing the .app file. You can download the source code directly and deploy it to your launch app such as [LaunchBar](https://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html) or [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) or any other apps with similar functions.

#### LaunchBar for Example

- **Step 1**

  Tap <kbd>command</kbd> + <kbd>space</kbd> together to wake the LaunchBar up and enter AE(action editor) into the search area to open the action editor

  ![launchbar search ae](README_img/launchbar1.png)

- **Step 2**

  Add a new action by clicking the add button in the left bottom corner

  ![add new action](README_img/launchbar2.png)

- **Step 3**

  Fill the action icon and name(**necessary** such as PasTk) or the other infomation you want into the form

  *icon shown above is available [here](https://github.com/LambolAlee/PasTk/tree/main/resources/logo)*

- **Step 4**

  1. Switch to the "Scripts" tab and change the programming language to Python and modified the file name with "main.py"

  2. As for options below, only keep run in background on

  ![connfigure](README_img/launchbar3.png)

- **Step 5**

  1. Right click the new generated action in the right list and select "show in finder"

     ![show in finder](README_img/launchbar4.png)

  2. Right click the "PasTk.lbaction" shown in finder and select "show package contents"

     ![show package contents](README_img/launchbar5.png)

- **Step 6**

  Move the source code into the `PasTk.lbaction/Contents/Scripts` folder and icon file into the `PasTk.lbaction/Contents/Resources` folder

  ***IMPORTANT:***  *LaunchBar will call system Python automaticlly so you may need to add shebang string to the top of main.py to specify the Python interpreter*

  ![move](README_img/launchbar6.png)

- **Step 7**

  Now you can use the app by tapping <kbd>ptk</kbd> into the launchbar:+1: (Of course you can assign shortcut to the action)

  ![use](README_img/launchbar7.png)

### Linux User

I don't have a Linux computer and I haven't used Linux system for a long time. May be support later.:pray:

- There are some musics in the resources directory you can try them via play button or you can add new music into it

  (***only mp3 or wav musics are supported now***)

![settings](README_img/pastk4.png)

![modes](README_img/pastk5.png)



- Merge paste: join all copied contents with a string (*default is ""*)

  <img src="README_img/pastk7.png">

  
- Segmented paste: join all copied contents with Enter (\\n)(*default*) or Tab (\\t)

  <img src="README_img/pastk8.png">
